# Design patterns

This is a collection of examples written in Ruby for different types of design patterns, structured in three categories:
* Creational patterns
* Structural patterns
* Behavioral patterns

I was able to explore them thanks to [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog), which is a great source of knowledge for this topic.
